Some words about continuous integraion.

Software development is long and difficult process and it's really good idea to use version control and up to date all the changes you've done in your program.

CI - is useful practice that saves (at least) time of the team by uploading the piece of code to some repositories, which is accessible by the team. Fast integration provides less time-consuming bug-seeking, faster delivery of the software.

Developers have the possibility to check out the code on shared repositories and commit the changes that is visible on the server. This code could be tested and if some issues occurred - its not a problem for team to fix them.

If developer started write the code and made some mistake, its ease to go back to the working code from the repository. Itâ€™s really important not to commit broken to untested code, because all team will have a problem in the end.

One more useful thing - continuous deployment, which is closely related to CI.
Using CD and CI reduce the risk for developers and save their time with software development and deployment.
